-= Fermion v1.5 =-

* Added device selection context menu, including remote socket support.
* Added JS trap for ctrl/command-t to refresh the Frida script in the target. It is now practical to collapse side-bar and work on your code.
* Added "GC" on the textarea. It was always a problem that high volume hooks could tank Fermion if the textarea grew too large. Fermion now limits the line count to 5000 and will delete old entries as new ones come in.
* Changed color for the text area. I think eventually a full UI re-design will probably be in order (v2 maybe).
* Added example: malloc, readFile, graphviz

* Four new themes: Amy, Oceanic Next, Tomorrow Night Blue, Vibrant Ink
* More minor UI colour changes. I'm still thinking of a full re-design for v2.

-= Fermion v1.7 =-

* Pre-built release updated to Frida v15.1.1
* Updated language bindings
* Better process information User/PID/PPID. On devices where "parameters.icons" have a type of RGBA they are drawn to a canvas inline. In my testing Ubuntu did not have icons in which case they are not drawn. The release notes for v15 say that some devices like IOS/Android now return a PNG byte array, currently those are not drawn either, PR's welcome.
* The main UI now has a button which retrieves Device information as per the new specs in the v15 release notes.

-= Fermion v1.8 =-

* Pre-built release updated to Frida v15.1.3. We are a few builds behind current (v15.1.11) this is because some Electron v15 compat changes need to be made before upgrading. The next release will have the current build.
* Full UI redesign
* Many many UI QOL changes (movable horizontal bar on the main window anyone :D)
* Added Frida JS API docs into Fermion
* Added an app-native CALL tracer into Fermion
* Got rid of Electron remote due to deprecation
* Some preparation to migrate to Electron v15.x though currently still on v13.x
